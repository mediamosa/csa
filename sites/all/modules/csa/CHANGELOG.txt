CSA v1.2.0 (build 170)
----------------------
- Upgraded Drupal to 6.33.
- Fixed notice on missing timezone when timezone isn't set in phg.ini.
- Updated ACL calls to support 3.x of MediaMosa. This version now requires
  MediaMosa 3.x.
- Fixed Publish and unpublished. For this fix, mediamosa 3.6 or higher is
  required.
- Puiblish and unpublish now longer adds or removes shared assets from apps the
  user can not change because of its acl app prefs.

CSA v1.1.0 (build 164)
----------------------
- Updated CSA to latest version of SDK. When upgrading to 1.1, make sure you
  disable all CSA modules and the MediaMosa connector module. Then upgrade the
  code; best is to replace the whole code tree (re-use the settings.php). What
  you need to know is that mediamosa_connector module has been moved. Drupal has
  no real method to fix this by update scripts. So its very important that you
  turn off the CSA module and mediamosa_connector module and then replace the
  code. Do not copy over the current version(!). BACKUP your database before you
  proceed!
- Fixed upload form.


CSA v1.0.9 (build 159)

  '&amp;' as default in drupal 6 instead of '&'.
